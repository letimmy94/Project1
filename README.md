Hello!
This is an Adventure Time themed memory flash card game.
Try and match all your favorite characters from the best show ever!
This game was built using DOM manipulation and hours of blood, sweat, and tears (not in order)
Images were taken off the internet. I don't own any of them.
This game is still a work in progress, but it functions and is ready to be played!

I started off creating an array for all the cards and their respective images. I then created an empty array for cards that get selected, or cards in play, which would be at a max of 2. I based my functions off of that, so when user clicks on a card, it would fill up the array with that selection. 
In order to show the 2 cards the user selects, i had to add alerts and a setTimeout function otherwise it would just not show the second selected card and just revert back to the back image. I don't know how to set a "delay" function without the alerts.
I found the randomizer function online somewhere. This "shuffles" all the cards around in random order each time user refreshes the page.
